            I have a text file with the content of several research papers. I need to organize these papers into different categories (folders). Each category should represent a unique subject or theme based on the content of the papers. Please help me by:

            1. Identifying the main themes or topics from the content of the papers.
            2. Providing a list of folder names that correspond to each theme.
            3. Assigning each paper to its appropriate folder based on its content. All papers should be assigned to a folder.
            4. The maximum number of folders is {max_num_folders}, but you can use less if the themes are not distinct.

            The structure of the text file is as follows:

            - Each paper's content is separated by a line with the paper's title followed by a blank line.
            - Below is a sample of the format:

                Title 1

                [Content of paper 1]

                Title 2

                [Content of paper 2]

            **Response Format:**
            1. **FOLDER LIST:**  
            - Begin the folder list with `### FOLDERS:`
            - List folders using the format: `folder_name`  
            - Folder names **must not contain special characters**, only letters, numbers, and spaces.

            2. **PAPER-FOLDER MAPPING:**
            - Begin with `### PAPER_FOLDER_MAPPING:`
            - Use a JSON format enclosed within triple backticks (` ```json ... ``` `).
            - The JSON should map `"paper title.pdf"` â†’ `"folder_name"`.
            - Use the exact paper title as it is in the text file.
